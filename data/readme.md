# Description of the data
The files in the folder `generated` should be automatically generated by some script.

- the files in tiebreaker contain the priority for each stage. 
- the file `allowed_kids.toml` is just a list of all kids that were allowed to come on days with Notbetreuung. 
  I.e., it just writes out all kids in all allowed groups of that day. This is just to be able to access this data 
  easier in the future, without reverting git to some stage to see how the groups looked on that day.  

The files in the folder `manually_updated` are maintained manually. They contain comments on their content and file 
format.
