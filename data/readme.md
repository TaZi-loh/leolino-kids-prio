# Description of the data
The files in the folder `generated` should be automatically generated by some script.

- the files in tiebreaker contain the priority for each stage. 
- the file `allowed_kids.toml` is just a list of all kids that were allowed to come on days with Notbetreuung. 
  I.e., it just writes out all kids in all allowed groups of that day. This is just to be able to access this data 
  easier in the future, without reverting git to some stage to see how the groups looked on that day.  

The files in the folder `manually_updated` are maintained manually. They contain comments on their content and file 
format.

### unused_days.toml
enter the values in a dict with keys being the dates and values being a list of children that offered their spot that
day. E.g., if groups A and B are allowed to come on the 1.4.2025 and Thomas (who is in group B) as well as Lian (from
group A) don't come, they are entered in this file like
"01.04.2025" = [ "Thomas", "Lian",]

### used_free_spots
enter the values in a dict with keys the dates and values being a list of children that used one of the free spots
that day. E.g., if groups A and B are allowed to come on the 1.4.2025, then there are two free spots. Assume that
Viola (group C) and Tino (group D) take those free spots, then they are entered in this file like
"01.04.2025" = [ "Viola", "Tino",]
